Jan-Becaus
==========

Jan Becaus (http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Becaus (Dutch)) is a Belgian news anchor. 
In addition to his noble appearance, he became famous with the very distinct pronounciation of English words in his Dutch texts.

The Belgian radio station Studio Brussel compiled a set of his most memorable moments (http://www.stubru.be/media/hetjanbecaussoundboard). 
All it took was someone on Twitter to suggest we put this into an app.
